## üìÑ Introduction

Welcome to the **Requirement Analysis in Software Development** repository.

This repository is created to provide a clear understanding of how requirement analysis is performed in the software development life cycle (SDLC). It includes explanations, examples, templates, and documentation that showcase the importance of gathering, analyzing, and documenting requirements before starting the development process.

The purpose of this repository is to help developers, students, and stakeholders understand how to capture functional and non-functional requirements effectively to ensure the success of software projects.

## ‚ùì What is Requirement Analysis?

**Requirement Analysis** is the process of gathering, analyzing, and defining what a software system should do based on stakeholder needs. It helps ensure the final product meets user expectations and business goals.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

1. **Ensures Clear Understanding**  
   It helps all stakeholders have a shared and clear understanding of what the software should do, reducing confusion and miscommunication.

2. **Reduces Risks and Costs**  
   Identifying requirements early prevents costly changes and rework during later stages of development.

3. **Improves Project Planning**  
   Accurate requirements enable better estimation of time, resources, and budget, leading to more efficient project management.

   ## üîë Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

- **Requirement Gathering**  
  Collecting initial information from stakeholders about what the system should do.

- **Requirement Elicitation**  
  Engaging with stakeholders through interviews, surveys, and workshops to uncover detailed needs and expectations.

- **Requirement Documentation**  
  Recording all gathered requirements clearly in structured documents like the Software Requirements Specification (SRS).

- **Requirement Analysis and Modeling**  
  Analyzing requirements to detect conflicts, gaps, or ambiguities and representing them using diagrams, models, or workflows.

- **Requirement Validation**  
  Reviewing requirements with stakeholders to ensure accuracy, completeness, and agreement before development begins.
